## System Components

### Frontend (React Single Page Application)
- **User Interface Layer**: React components for user interaction
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state
- **API Integration**: Axios for API requests
- **Form Handling**: Formik and Yup for form validation
- **UI Framework**: Material UI for consistent design
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF and react-pdf for letter generation and preview

### Backend (Express.js API)
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for client communication
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Business Logic**: Letter generation, user management, subscription handling
- **Data Access Layer**: Mongoose ODM for MongoDB interaction
- **External Service Integration**: Payment processing, email services

### Database (MongoDB)
- **Collections**: Users, DisputeLetters, DisputeTemplates, Transactions, AffiliateLinks
- **Indexes**: Optimized for query performance
- **Data Validation**: Schema-level validation

### External Services
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe for subscription and one-time payments
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer for sending dispute letters and notifications
- **Affiliate Tracking**: Custom tracking for affiliate link conversions

## Data Flow

### User Registration and Authentication
1. User submits registration form
2. Backend validates data and creates user account
3. JWT token generated and returned to client
4. Client stores token for authenticated requests

### Dispute Letter Generation
1. User inputs personal information, creditor details, and dispute reason
2. User selects dispute category and letter format
3. Frontend sends data to backend API
4. Backend processes data and selects appropriate template
5. Letter content generated based on inputs and template
6. Generated letter returned to frontend for preview
7. User can download letter as PDF or save for later

### Subscription Management
1. User selects subscription plan
2. Frontend redirects to payment processing
3. Payment confirmation sent to backend
4. Backend updates user subscription status
5. Premium features unlocked for user

## Security Considerations
- HTTPS for all communications
- JWT authentication with token expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation on both client and server
- CORS configuration to restrict API access
- Helmet.js for HTTP header security
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Scalability Considerations
- Stateless backend for horizontal scaling
- Database indexing for query optimization
- Caching strategies for template content
- Asynchronous processing for PDF generation
- Containerization for deployment flexibility
